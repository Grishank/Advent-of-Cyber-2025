## 🧭 Overview  
At The Best Festival Company (TBFC), the elves are busier than ever preparing for Christmas — but this year, they have a new helper.  
Their old chatbot, *Van Chatty*, could not keep up with modern demands, so TBFC is now testing a powerful new AI security assistant named **Van SolveIT**.

This AI agent is designed to help across defensive, offensive, and software tasks — boosting efficiency and handling the tedious work so the elves can focus on the real magic.

Today’s room explores **how AI can be integrated into cyber security workflows**, what its strengths are, and what limitations must be considered.

# 🧩 Task-by-Task Write-Up

---

## **📝 Task 1 — Understanding AI in Cyber Security**  
The exercise introduces how AI is now woven into cyber security tools, workflows, and automation.

Key points:
- AI helps process **large volumes of data** (logs, alerts, telemetry).  
- AI identifies **behavioural anomalies** faster than humans.  
- Generative AI can **summarise incidents** or explain attack chains.  
- AI boosts both **defensive** and **offensive** operations.

## **🤖 Task 2 — AI Use Cases in Security**  

### **Defensive Security**
AI assists blue teams by:
- speeding up detection  
- adding context to alerts  
- correlating logs  
- helping automate responses (e.g., isolate hosts, block emails)  

### **Offensive Security**
AI helps red teams by:
- performing reconnaissance  
- cleaning up noisy scan results  
- analysing attack surfaces  
- generating proof-of-concept scripts  

### **Software Security**
AI contributes by:
- aiding code analysis  
- performing automated SAST/DAST  
- identifying vulnerabilities  
- supporting developers during coding  

Ironically:  
AI can spot vulnerabilities well — but isn’t always great at writing secure code.

---

## **📘 Task 3 — Considerations When Using AI in Cyber Security**  
AI isn’t perfect — especially in security-critical environments.

Concerns include:
- Model mistakes (hallucinations)  
- Incorrect vulnerability assessments  
- Unpredictable behaviour  
- Data privacy and model training sources  
- Potential harm during offensive tasks (e.g., overloading a client’s system)  
- Need for human verification and oversight  

AI is powerful, but **not a replacement for human judgment**.

---

## **🧪 Task 4 — Practical Showcase: Using Van SolveIT**  
In the final section, we interact with Van SolveIT through three showcases:

### **🔴 Red Team Task**
Generate and execute an exploit script against a vulnerable application.

Flag obtained:
```
THM{SQLI_EXPLOIT}
```

### **🔵 Blue Team Task**
Analyse web logs of an attack to identify threats and confirm activity.

### **⚙️ Software Security Task**
Analyse source code for vulnerabilities with the help of the AI assistant.

After completing all stages successfully, the final showcase provides a completion flag:

```
THM{AI_MANIA}
```

This demonstrates how AI can support multiple security domains in one workflow.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Understand how AI assists various cyber security roles  
- Learn where AI can accelerate workflows (red, blue, software)  
- Explore AI assistants in real hands-on tasks  
- Recognise limitations and risks of AI in security operations  

---

# 📘 What I Learned Today  
- AI can meaningfully support SOC teams, pentesters, and developers  
- AI is best used as a **tool**, not as an absolute authority  
- Human oversight is essential, especially when handling exploits or code  
- AI-powered automation can dramatically improve triage and analysis  
- Ethical and safety considerations must always accompany AI usage  

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaway  
> “AI boosts speed — but human expertise ensures accuracy. Together, they become a powerful cyber security force.”
