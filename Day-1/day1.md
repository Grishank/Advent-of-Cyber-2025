## 🧭 Overview  
The unthinkable has occurred — **McSkidy has been kidnapped**.

Wareville’s defenses are weakening, and Christmas is in danger. The TBFC (The Best Festival Company) gathers quickly, and their first lead directs them to **tbfc-web01**, a Linux server handling Christmas wishlists.

Hidden somewhere inside this machine may be:  
- McSkidy’s last recorded actions  
- traces of King Malhare  
- the first clues toward uncovering the EASTMAS plot

Your mission begins by exploring this server using the **Linux command-line interface (CLI)**.

# 🧩 Task-by-Task Write-Up

---

## **📝 Task 1 — Introduction**
A cartoon scene depicts McSkidy facing King Malhare, who wields a USB scepter. Two glowing circuit-patterned eggs and a robotic black bunny hint at something deeper.

This task sets the story and explains the investigation path.

---

## **🐧 Task 2 — Basic Linux Navigation**
Learned essential Linux commands:
- `ls` — list files  
- `cd` — move between directories  
- `pwd` — confirm current location  
- `cat`, `less` — read file contents  

These allowed initial exploration of the server and its logs.

---

## **📂 Task 3 — Investigating the Filesystem**
Explored:
- system folders  
- user directories  
- log files  
- hidden files  

Located clues suggesting unusual activity before McSkidy disappeared.

---

## **🕵️ Task 4 — Log Analysis**
Focused on:
- reading `/var/log` files  
- checking command history  
- identifying suspicious entries  
- tracing user actions  

Found hints pointing to McSkidy’s last login and commands run before the abduction.
